A secure password-based text encryption and decryption web app built using Python, Streamlit, and Cryptography.
This application allows users to encrypt sensitive text and decrypt it later using the same password.

The project demonstrates practical implementation of modern cryptographic techniques including PBKDF2 key derivation, AES-256 encryption, random salt generation, and Base64 encoding.
